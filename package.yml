summary    : Yodl implements a pre-document language and tools to process it
description: |
    Yodl is a package that implements a pre-document language and tools to process it.  The idea of Yodl is that you write up a document in a pre-language, then use the tools (e.g. yodl2html) to convert it to some final document language. Current converters are for HTML, ms, man, LaTeX, a simple txt converter and an experimental XML converter.  Main document types are "article", "book", "letter", "manpage" and  "report". The Yodl document language is designed to be easy to use and extensible.
